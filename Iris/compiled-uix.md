# Compiled UIX
Compiled UIX (often shortened to "UIB" for "UI Binary") is one of two formats used by Iris 3.0+ for defining user interfaces. UIB is generated by passing one or more UIX XML files to the UIX compiler. The UI definition is pre-processed into custom bytecode alongside a slew of data tables. The bytecode portion is conceptually similar to emulating a CPU. UIB instructions are much higher level, but they are still relatively simple instructions that are interpreted in a loop that fetches the instruction, decodes the operands, and executes it.

## TODO
- list the tables
    - AliasTable
    - ConstantsTable
    - LineNumberTable
    - type imports/exports
> Iris has two separate type systems-- the runtime types, which are your standard .NET types; and the markup type schemas, which of course are .NET types themselves, but are used to wrap runtime types for use by the UIX compiler and interpreter. Mapping from schema to runtime type and constructing instances from strings is easy enough, because those are both tasks the original UIX tooling has to do. Doing the reverse (finding the schema for a given runtime type, or encoding a runtime object into a string that can be parsed later) is much more difficult.
