# Gem Files
Gem Files are essentially ``.XZP`` files (from XBOX) and pack multiple GUI related files into one archive. They contain the resources like images, layouts, controls, localization data, and so on. They are created using the Xbox UI Tool which is part of the XBOX SDK.  

Gem/XZP Files can be unpacked, and contain ``.XUI``, ``.XUR`` and ``.XUS`` files.
A Tool called ``XUIWorkshop`` was used to edit later versions of the file used by the XBOX. The expected version (found in the header of the file) is ``8`` but the Zune's gem files are at Version ``5``. 

The official tool (``XUITool``) to edit the UI was shipped with the XBOX SDK. 

## Tools
- [[Tools/XzpTool 2.exe]]: Can be used to extract the files.
