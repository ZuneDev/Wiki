# CE 6.0 Architecture

## System Files/Components
### K.xxx.DLL
These DLLs reflect the same DLLs without the K in front of it, but live in Kernel space. This way when porting old drivers from Windows CE 5.0 (where all drivers lived in user mode) the code can simply call the same API, but it does not need to perform a context switch. User mode calls are handled by ``Coredll.dll`` and calls from processes running in kernel mode are redirected to ``Kernel.DLL`` by ``K.Coredll.DLL`` so that the call stays in the same VM. This way the calls are way faster compared to Windows CE 5.0.

Any DLL that is use by both kernel-mode and user-mode processes will be loaded as both kernel-mode and user-mode.

### Services
Services run in user-mode and are handled by the ``Services Manager``.

### Device Manager
The [[Device Manager]] (``Device.DLL``) runs in kernel-mode and loads the device drivers. It supports loading drivers on boot or on demand. Windows also provides a user-mode Device Manager for drivers installed after shipping for example.

### NK.EXE
This used to be the kernel, but now it just contains a thin abstraction layer and compatibility layer, provided by the OEM. The actual Kernel now lives in ``Kernel.DLL``.

## Security
Windows CE 6.0 removed both the "all kernel mode" (running everything in kernel mode) feature and the trusted model (trusted and untrusted .EXEs and DLLs). It also does not have the Access Control List of newer desktop systems.

The system also provides a separate handle table for each process.

## GWES
GWES provides graphical functionality.
